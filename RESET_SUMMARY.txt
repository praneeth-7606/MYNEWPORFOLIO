========================================
  COMPLETE RESET DONE!
========================================

WHAT I DID:
  1. Killed ALL Node processes (4 were running!)
  2. Deleted .next folder
  3. Deleted node_modules\.cache
  4. Created clean-rebuild.bat script

THE PROBLEM:
  Multiple Node processes were running
  Old dev server was still serving old code
  That's why cache clear didn't help!

DO THIS NOW:
  1. Run: npm run dev
  2. Wait for 'Compiled successfully'
  3. Open: http://localhost:3000
  4. Should see NEW version!

QUICK SCRIPT:
  Next time, just double-click:
  → clean-rebuild.bat

DOCUMENTATION:
  → COMPLETE_RESET.md - Full guide

========================================
  Now run: npm run dev
